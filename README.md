# \## Week 4 Day 1 Java Generics: Best Practices \& Real-World Scenarios  

# \*\*Date: 17-Jan-2026\*\*

# 

# Day 1 of Week 4 focused on mastering \*\*Java Generics\*\* to write type-safe, reusable, and scalable code. The goal was to move beyond syntax and apply generics to realistic system design problems.

# 

# \### 📝 Topics Covered

# \- Implemented \*\*type-safe programming\*\* using generics (`<T>`, `<E>`, `<K, V>`).

# \- Preferred \*\*generic methods\*\* over excessive method overloading.

# \- Used \*\*bounded wildcards\*\* (`? extends T`, `? super T`) for flexibility with safety.

# \- Avoided \*\*raw types\*\* and understood limitations caused by \*\*type erasure\*\*.

# \- Designed \*\*clean, maintainable, and reusable generic APIs\*\*.

# 

# \### Scenario-Based Implementations

# 1\. \*\*Smart Warehouse Management System\*\*  

# &nbsp;  - Generic storage handling multiple item types with bounds.  

# 

# 2\. \*\*Dynamic Online Marketplace\*\*  

# &nbsp;  - Generic product catalogs with category constraints.

# 

# 3\. \*\*University Course Management System\*\*  

# &nbsp;  - Generic course models with flexible evaluation schemes. 

# 

# 4\. \*\*Personalized Meal Plan Generator\*\*  

# &nbsp;  - Type-restricted meal planning using bounded generics.  

# 

# 5\. \*\*AI-Driven Resume Screening System\*\*  

# &nbsp;  - Generic resume processing across multiple job roles.  

# &nbsp;  - Flexible screening pipelines using wildcards.

# \## Week 4 Day 2 Java Collections Framework – Advanced Usage  

# \*\*Date: 18-Jan-2026\*\*

# 

# On Day 2 of Week 4, I deepened my understanding of the \*\*Java Collections Framework\*\* by focusing on advanced operations, internal behaviors, and real-world decision-making while selecting collections.

# 

# \### 📝 Topics Covered

# \- Internal working and performance characteristics of core collections.

# \- Differences between \*\*ArrayList vs LinkedList\*\*, \*\*HashSet vs TreeSet\*\*, and \*\*HashMap vs TreeMap\*\*.

# \- Importance of \*\*hashing, equals(), and compareTo()\*\* in collections.

# \- Use of \*\*Iterators, enhanced for-loops, and collection traversal techniques\*\*.

# \- Time and space complexity analysis for common collection operations.

# 

# \### Practical Implementations

# \- Implemented CRUD operations using different collection types.

# \- Used collections for real-world scenarios like student records, frequency counting, and task queues.

# \- Applied sorting using \*\*Comparable and Comparator\*\* interfaces.

# \- Chose optimal collections based on access patterns and performance needs.

# \## Week 4 Day 3 Java File Handling \& Streams  

# \*\*Date: 19-Jan-2026\*\*

# 

# \### 📝Topics Covered

# \- Core Java I/O concepts including \*\*InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, and Writer\*\* hierarchies.

# \- File reading and writing using \*\*buffered and unbuffered streams\*\* and their performance differences.

# \- Handling persistent data using \*\*serialization and deserialization\*\*.

# \- Working with \*\*byte streams, character streams, and data streams\*\*.

# \- Exception handling and resource management using \*\*try-with-resources\*\*.

# 

# \### Practical Implementations

# \- Reading and writing large files efficiently.

# \- Word frequency analysis from text files.

# \- Error log scanning and structured file processing.

# \- Handling binary and text-based data safely.
