## Week 2: Object-oriented Programming

---

### 📅 Week 2 Day 1 – Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

- Studied Procedural Programming and its limitations.
- Compared Procedural Programming with Object-Oriented Programming.
- Understood why OOP is preferred in modern software development.
- Learned core OOP concepts:
  - Class  
  - Object  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Abstraction  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  

- Implemented a sample program using procedural approach.
- Committed and pushed solutions to the repository.

### 📅 Week 2 Day 2 – Constructors, Variables & Access Modifiers  
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**

### 📘 Topics Covered
- Learned about **constructors** and their role in object initialization:
  - Default constructors  
  - Parameterized constructors  
  - Constructor chaining using `this()`  
  - Copy constructors  

- Explored **instance variables vs class (static) variables**:
  - Instance variables belong to individual objects.
  - Static variables are shared across all objects of a class.

- Practiced **instance methods vs static methods** and their use cases.

- Gained hands-on experience with **access modifiers**:
  - `public`
  - `protected`
  - `private`
  - Understood how access levels affect visibility across classes and subclasses.

### 📅 Week 2 Day 3 – Keywords & Scenario-Based Programming

**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- Learned and implemented important Java keywords:
  - `this` – to refer to current class instance variables and methods.
  - `static` – to define class-level variables and methods.
  - `final` – to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.

- Understood differences between:
  - this vs static
  - Instance members vs static members
  - Final variables vs non-final variables

- Solved scenario-based problems to strengthen real-world understanding:
  - Parking Lot Management System
  - Phone Recharge Simulation
  - Number Guessing Game
  - Discount Calculation System

- Focused on:
  - Logical flow building
  - Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
  - Looping constructs
  - Clean and readable code structure

- Improved debugging skills and code readability.

### Week 2 Day 4 – Scenario-Based Design & Object Modeling

**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**

### 📘 Topics Covered
 - Practiced real-world scenario-based problem solving using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
 - Learned how to identify entities, attributes, and relationships from problem statements.
 - Designed and implemented object models before writing code.
 - Understood and applied different types of relationships:
   - Association – objects related but independent
   - Aggregation – “has-a” relationship with independent lifecycles
   - Composition – strong ownership and dependency

 - Key Concepts Applied
    - Breaking real-world problems into:
    - Classes
    - Objects
    - Responsibilities

 - Mapping real-life scenarios into:
    - Class diagrams (conceptual understanding)
    - Logical method responsibilities

### 📅 Week 2 Day 5 – Inheritance & Types of Inheritance in Java  
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)**

### 📘 Topics Covered

- Learned the concept of **Inheritance** in Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Reusing properties and behaviors of an existing class.
  - Promoting code reusability and logical hierarchy.
  - Understanding the `extends` keyword.

- Explored different **types of inheritance supported in Java**:
  - **Single Inheritance** – One child class inherits from one parent class.
  - **Multilevel Inheritance** – A class derived from another derived class.
  - **Hierarchical Inheritance** – Multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class.
  - **Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces)** – Achieved using interfaces since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes.
  - **Hybrid Inheritance (conceptual)** – Combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance using interfaces.

- Practiced usage of:
  - `super` keyword to access parent class constructors and methods.
  - Method overriding and runtime polymorphism.
  - Accessing inherited members based on access modifiers.

- Understood important inheritance rules:
  - Constructors are not inherited.
  - Private members are not directly accessible in child classes.
  - Method overriding requires same method signature.
  - `final` methods cannot be overridden.

- Implemented real-world examples such as:
  - Person → Waiter → Chef hierarchy
  - Vehicle → Electrical Vehicle
  - Student → Teacher → Staff 

- Focused on:
  - Clean class hierarchy design
  - Avoiding tight coupling
  - Writing reusable and maintainable code
