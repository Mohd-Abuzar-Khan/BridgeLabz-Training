# ⚙️ Design Principles, Design Patterns & Multithreading - Week 7

This week focused on writing **clean, scalable, and production-ready Java code** by mastering software design fundamentals and understanding how modern applications handle concurrency. The goal was to strengthen **system design thinking**, improve **code maintainability**, and prepare for **product-based company interviews**.

## 📅 Week 7 Day 01 – Design Principles  
**(Date: 01-Feb-2026)**  

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Studied **SOLID principles** to design maintainable and loosely coupled systems  
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
- Applied **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** to eliminate redundant code  
- Followed **KISS (Keep It Simple)** to improve readability and reduce unnecessary complexity  
- Learned **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)** to avoid premature optimization  
- Understood how strong design principles directly improve **scalability, testing, and long-term maintainability**

## 📅 Week 7 Day 02 – Design Patterns  
**(Date: 02-Feb-2026)**  

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Learned how design patterns provide **proven solutions to recurring software problems**
- **Creational Patterns:**  
  - Singleton – ensured controlled instance creation  
  - Factory Method – improved object creation flexibility  
  - Builder – constructed complex objects step-by-step  

- **Structural Patterns:**  
  - Adapter – integrated incompatible interfaces  
  - Decorator – added behavior dynamically without modifying code  
  - Facade – simplified interaction with complex subsystems  

- **Behavioral Patterns:**  
  - Strategy – enabled dynamic algorithm selection  
  - Observer – implemented event-driven communication  
  - Command – encapsulated requests as objects  

- Connected patterns to **real-world architecture and interview scenarios**

## 📅 Week 7 Day 03 – Multithreading & Concurrency in Java  
**(Date: 03-Feb-2026)**  

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Understood the role of multithreading in **high-performance and responsive applications**
- Created threads using **Thread class, Runnable, and Callable**
- Explored the **thread lifecycle** and state transitions  
- Implemented **synchronization** to protect shared resources  
- Practiced **inter-thread communication** with `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`  
- Studied concurrency issues such as **deadlock, starvation, and livelock**  
- Used the **Executor Framework** and thread pools for efficient resource management  
- Learned about **volatile variables, atomic operations, and thread-safe collections**  
- Compared **single-threaded vs multi-threaded models** using practical examples
