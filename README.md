## Week 4 Day 1 – Java Generics: Best Practices & Real-World Scenarios  
**Date: 17-Jan-2026**

Day 1 focused on mastering **Java Generics** to build reusable, type-safe components and apply them to realistic system design problems.

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Type-safe programming using generics (`<T>`, `<E>`, `<K, V>`).
- Generic methods preferred over excessive method overloading.
- Bounded wildcards (`? extends T`, `? super T`) for flexibility with safety.
- Avoiding raw types and understanding **type erasure** limitations.
- Designing clean, maintainable, reusable generic APIs.

### Scenario-Based Implementations
- Smart Warehouse Management System  
- Dynamic Online Marketplace  
- University Course Management System  
- Personalized Meal Plan Generator  
- AI-Driven Resume Screening System
