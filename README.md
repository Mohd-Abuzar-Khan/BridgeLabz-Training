## 📅 Week 5 Day 1 - CSV Data Handling
**(Date: 25-Jan-2026)**

**Topics Covered:**
- Reading and writing CSV files
- Counting rows in CSV
- Filtering, searching, and modifying records
- Sorting CSV data
- Validating CSV data
- Working with large CSV files efficiently
- Merging CSV files
- Converting CSV data to Java objects
- Encrypting and decrypting sensitive CSV data
- Generating CSV reports from databases

**Practice Problems:**

1. **Read a CSV File and Print Data**  
   - Read a CSV file containing student details (ID, Name, Age, Marks).  
   - Print each record in a structured format.

2. **Write Data to a CSV File**  
   - Create a CSV file with employee details (ID, Name, Department, Salary).  
   - Write at least 5 records to the file.

3. **Read and Count Rows in a CSV File**  
   - Read a CSV file and count the number of records (excluding header row).

4. **Filter Records from CSV**  
   - Filter students with marks greater than 80.

5. **Search for a Record in CSV**  
   - Search for an employee by name and print department & salary.

6. **Modify a CSV File (Update a Value)**  
   - Increase salary of "IT" employees by 10% and save updated CSV.

7. **Sort CSV Records by a Column**  
   - Sort records by salary in descending order and print top 5.

8. **Validate CSV Data**  
   - Check email format and 10-digit phone numbers.  
   - Print invalid rows with error messages.

9. **Convert CSV Data into Java Objects**  
   - Read CSV and convert each row into `Student` objects stored in a list.

10. **Merge Two CSV Files**  
    - Merge `students1.csv` and `students2.csv` based on ID.

11. **Read Large CSV File Efficiently**  
    - Read 500MB+ CSV in chunks of 100 lines.  
    - Display processed record count.

12. **Detect Duplicates in a CSV File**  
    - Find duplicate entries based on ID and print them.

13. **Generate CSV Report from Database**  
    - Fetch employee records from DB and write CSV with headers.

14. **Convert JSON to CSV and Vice Versa**  
    - Convert JSON student list to CSV and back to JSON.

15. **Encrypt and Decrypt CSV Data**  
    - Encrypt sensitive fields (Salary, Email) when writing.  
    - Decrypt when reading.

**Practice Problems:**

1. **Create Student JSON**  
   - Create JSON file containing student details.

2. **Extract JSON Fields**  
   - Extract specific fields like name, email, age.

3. **Filter JSON by Age**  
   - Filter JSON records where age > threshold.

4. **Filter Users by Age**  
   - Print users older than a certain age.

5. **Java Object to JSON (Car Example)**  
   - Convert a `Car` object to JSON format.

6. **Generate JSON from Database**  
   - Generate JSON report from employee records.

7. **Convert JSON to XML**  
   - Convert JSON format data to XML.

8. **List of Objects to JSON Array**  
   - Convert list of `Student` objects to a JSON array.

9. **Merge JSON Objects**  
   - Merge two JSON objects into one.

10. **Merge Two JSON Files**  
    - Merge two JSON files into a single JSON object.

11. **Print JSON Keys and Values**  
    - Print all keys and values from a JSON file.

12. **Validate Email in JSON**  
    - Validate email fields using regex.

13. **Validate JSON Structure**  
    - Check JSON structure using basic validation.
