## 📅 Week 8 Day 01 – Indexing in MySQL  
**Date:** 05-Feb-2026  

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Learned the concept of **indexing** as a data structure that speeds up data retrieval and minimizes full table scans  
- Explored various **index types**: Primary, Unique, Regular, Composite, Full-Text, and Spatial  
- Understood how **B-Tree indexes** enable **O(log n)** search time for faster query execution  
- Practiced **creating, viewing, and dropping indexes** and evaluated performance using **EXPLAIN**  
- Studied **composite indexes**, the **leftmost prefix rule**, and covering indexes  
- Analyzed **trade-offs** — improved read performance vs slower writes and increased storage

## 📅 Week 8 Day 02 – MySQL Queries & Data Retrieval  
**Date:** 06-Feb-2026  

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Practiced core SQL operations: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`  
- Mastered filtering using `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, and logical operators  
- Learned **sorting and pagination** with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`  
- Applied **aggregate functions** (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  
- Implemented **JOINs** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to retrieve relational data across tables  
- Focused on writing **optimized and readable SQL queries** aligned with industry standards

## 📅 Week 8 Day 03 – Basics of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)  
**Date:** 07-Feb-2026  

### 📝 Topics Covered
- Understood **JDBC architecture** and its role in connecting Java applications to databases  
- Learned the **JDBC workflow**: load driver → establish connection → create statement → execute query → close resources  
- Connected Java to **MySQL** using `DriverManager` with secure credential handling  
- Executed queries using **Statement** and **PreparedStatement**, emphasizing SQL injection prevention  
- Retrieved data via **ResultSet** and mapped records to Java objects  
- Followed best practices such as **try-with-resources** for automatic resource cleanup
