## 📅 Day 18 – Sorting Algorithms – Complete Overview  
**(Date: 05-Jan-2026)**

### 📝 Topics Covered

Studied **7 essential sorting algorithms** in Java, focusing on concepts, complexities, and use cases:

### Sorting Algorithms Overview

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Swaps adjacent elements repeatedly.
   - Best for small or nearly sorted arrays.

2. **Insertion Sort**
   - Inserts elements into their correct position.
   - Efficient for small and adaptive datasets.

3. **Selection Sort**
   - Selects the minimum element and places it at the start.
   - Simple but inefficient for large data.

4. **Counting Sort**
   - Counts element frequencies and reconstructs the array.
   - Works well for integers with a limited range.

5. **Merge Sort**
   - Divides array, sorts recursively, then merges.
   - Stable and efficient for large datasets.

6. **Quick Sort**
   - Partitions array around a pivot.
   - Very fast on average for large datasets.

7. **Heap Sort**
   - Uses heap structure to sort elements.
   - In-place and good for priority-based sorting.

### 🔹 Comparison Table

| Algorithm       | Best Case   | Average Case | Worst Case | Space   | Stable |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------|--------|--------|
| Bubble Sort      | O(n)       | O(n²)       | O(n²)      | O(1)   | Yes    |
| Insertion Sort   | O(n)       | O(n²)       | O(n²)      | O(1)   | Yes    |
| Selection Sort   | O(n²)      | O(n²)       | O(n²)      | O(1)   | No     |
| Counting Sort    | O(n+k)     | O(n+k)      | O(n+k)     | O(k)   | Yes    |
| Merge Sort       | O(n log n) | O(n log n)  | O(n log n) | O(n)   | Yes    |
| Quick Sort       | O(n log n) | O(n log n)  | O(n²)      | O(log n)| No    |
| Heap Sort        | O(n log n) | O(n log n)  | O(n log n) | O(1)   | No     |

### Algorithm Analysis & Big O – Scenario-Based Insights

- Studied **Big O Notation** to evaluate time & space complexity for growing inputs.

**Scenario-Based Learnings**

1. **Searching Large Datasets**
   - Linear Search → O(N)
   - Binary Search → O(log N)  Efficient for large, sorted data

2. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Bubble Sort → O(N²)
   - Merge Sort → O(N log N)
   - Quick Sort → O(N log N) Avoid Bubble Sort for large inputs

3. **String Concatenation**
   - `String` → O(N²)
   - `StringBuilder` / `StringBuffer` → O(N) Mutable strings are faster

4. **Large File Reading**
   - `FileReader` → Slower (character-based)
   - `InputStreamReader` → Faster (byte-based) Efficient stream selection matters

5. **Fibonacci Computation**
   - Recursive → O(2ⁿ)
   - Iterative → O(N) Iterative is faster & memory-efficient

6. **Data Structure Lookups**
   - Array → O(N)
   - HashSet → O(1)
   - TreeSet → O(log N) HashSet offers fastest lookup; TreeSet maintains order
